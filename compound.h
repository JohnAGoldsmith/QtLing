/*!
 * \brief CompoundComponent is a class that contains information about a word
 * that can be considered a part (or "components") of compound words.
 *
 * For instance, the word "lighthouse" is composed of two parts, "light" and
 * "house". "light" and "house" are each represented by a CompoundComponent
 * object. Each compound word has a list of connections, i.e. a list that keeps
 * track which words this component appeared in, and what position in that
 * word. e.g. the CompoundComponent object of "light" would have in its
 * m_connections the following entry in its m_connections map:
 *   key: "lighthouse", value: (0, <ptr>)
 * where 0 represents the leftmost position in a compound word, and <ptr>
 * is a pointer to the corresponding CompoundWord object for "lighthouse".

 * of these two words. A list of compositions is stored because Linguistica
 * may find multiple possible compositions for one word.
