Multiple signatures per word are permitted; this needs to be undone.

How? Remove from a signature any word that has been analyzed in a more robust signature? But then some signatures have holes in them (for a given stem, only some of the affixes are "real")

Linguistica is very confused by the presence of punctuation -- completely dominates the true suffix structure discovery.

The structure of the code is too complicated.

It's become opaque to me...

Did not yet include unanalyzed words. 

Quite a few arbitrary decisions:
	1. Pointers to signatures
	2. Pointers to affixes based on corpus count (or on word token count? or signature usage?)
