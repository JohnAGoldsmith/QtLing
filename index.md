# Linguistica

## Overview

Linguistica is the name of a series of programs that I've written, along with student collaborators, since around 2000. The goal of each is to take a wordlist from a language and analyze the prefixes, suffixes, and some of the allomorphy involved in the affixation.

The code has almost entirely be written in Qt C++. Arix Xanthos and Jackson Lee have written some python code that represents some of the functionality of Linguistica, and that work can be found on their webpages.

The current version is called Crab (after the Crab Nebula), and it is in current development as of February 2024.
